[00:00.41] Raw fear
[00:09.42] Raw fear
[00:13.42] 
[00:18.18] Raw fear moves me, sounds of empty Uzis
[00:22.41] Life is just forever nippin' heels, never slowin' down
[00:26.65] Raw fear moves me, sounds of empty Uzis
[00:31.06] Life is just forever grippin' feels, never slowin' down
[00:58.56] 
[00:35.95] You know what scares me? Nah, it's stupid
[00:40.25] You've met my fears, they're all regulars
[00:42.28] Wait, who's the new kid?
[00:44.63] You know what kills me? Not gettin' stronger
[00:48.82] And now I can't seem to sit still any longer
[01:10.82] 
[00:53.04] Raw fear moves me, sounds of empty Uzis
[00:57.39] Life is just forever nippin' heels, never slowin' down
[01:01.64] Raw fear moves me, sounds of empty Uzis
[01:06.01] Life is just forever grippin' feels, never slowin' down
[01:16.02] (I can't seem to sit still any longer)
[01:19.24] Raw fear moves me, sounds of empty Uzis
[01:23.49] Life is just forever grippin' feels, never slowin' down
[01:50.99] 
[01:29.18] (Never slowin' down)
[01:30.75] (Never slowin' down)
[01:32.40] (Never, never slowin' down)
[01:34.73] (Never slowin' down)

[01:38.77] (Never slowin' down)
[01:40.26] (Never, never slowin' down)
[01:53.76] 
[01:40.63] Learnin' all that really matters is a slow and painful lesson (never slowin' down, never slowin' down)
[01:44.45] It is not pass or fail, but a poisonous progression (never slowin' down, never slowin' down)
[01:48.44] Try to micro-dose to immunity, but you'll never, ever get it (never slowin' down, never slowin' down)
[01:52.20] And I go, ah, ah, ah (never slowin' down), "What's the matter?" isn't helpin' (never slowin' down)
[02:41.20] 
[01:56.26] You go, ooh, ooh, ooh (never slowin' down), I wish her parents would stop yellin' (never slowin' down)
[02:00.67] I could build a tower with the times I was pretendin' (never slowin' down)
[02:03.91] Try to micro-dose to immunity, but I'll never see the endin' (never slowin' down)
[02:07.99] And I go, ah, ah, ah (never slowin' down), "What's the matter?" isn't helpin' (never slowin' down)
[02:56.99] 
[02:11.95] You go, ooh, ooh, ooh (never slowin' down), I wish her parents would stop yellin'
[02:16.01] You know what scares me? (Ah, ah, ah) nah, it's stupid
[02:19.83] And you go, ooh, ooh, ooh, wait, who's the new kid? (Never slowin' down)
[02:23.71] And you go, ah, ah, ah, not gettin' stronger
[02:27.67] And now I can't seem to sit still any longer
[02:49.67] 
[02:31.50] Raw fear moves me, sounds of empty Uzis (ah, ah, ah)
[02:35.89] Life is just forever nippin' heels, never slowin' down
[02:40.20] Raw fear moves me, sounds of empty Uzis (ah, ah, ah)
[02:44.52] Life is just forever grippin' feels, never slowin' down
[03:12.02]
