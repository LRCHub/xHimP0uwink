Raw fear
Raw fear
Raw fear moves me,
sounds of empty Uzis
Life is just forever nipping heels,
never slowing down
Raw fear moves me,
sounds of empty Uzis
Life is just forever gripping feels,
never slowing down
You know what scares me?
Nah, it's stupid
You've met my fears,
they're all regulars
Wait, who's the new kid?
You know what kills me?
Not getting stronger
And now
I can't seem to sit still any longer
Raw fear moves me,
sounds of empty Uzis
Life is just forever nipping heels,
never slowing down
Raw fear moves me,
sounds of empty Uzis
Life is just forever gripping feels,
never slowing down
(I can't seem to sit still any longer)
Raw fear moves me,
sounds of empty Uzis
Life is just forever gripping feels,
never slowing down
(Never slowing down)
(Never slowing down)
(Never, never slowing down)
(Never slowing down)
(Never, never slowing down)
(Never slowing down)
(Never, never slowing down)
Learning all that really matters
is a slow and painful lesson
It is not pass or fail,
but a poisonous progression
Try to micro-dose to immunity
but you'll never, ever get it
And I go, ah, ah, ah
"What's the matter?" isn't helping
You go, ooh, ooh, ooh
I wish her parents would stop yelling
I could build a tower with the times
I was pretending
Try to micro-dose to immunity
but I'll never see the ending
And I go, ah, ah, ah
"What's the matter?" isn't helping
You go, ooh, ooh, ooh
I wish her parents would stop yelling
You know what scares me?
(Ah, ah, ah)
Nah, it's stupid
And you go, ooh, ooh, ooh
Wait, who's the new kid?
And you go, ah, ah, ah
Not getting stronger
And now
I can't seem to sit still any longer
Raw fear moves me,
sounds of empty Uzis
Life is just forever nipping heels,
never slowing down
Raw fear moves me,
sounds of empty Uzis
Life is just forever gripping feels,
never slowing down
Raw fear moves me,
sounds of empty Uzis
Life is just forever nipping heels,
never slowing down
Raw fear moves me,
sounds of empty Uzis
Life is just forever gripping feels,
never slowing down
